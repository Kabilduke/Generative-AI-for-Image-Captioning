# Generative-AI-for-Image-Captioning

In the age of social media, the demand for high-quality content with engaging captions is paramount for audience engagement and community building. This research explores the transformative impact of Generative AI, exceeding initial expectations. 

The study focuses on CNN and RNN, specifically LSTM, for image detection and caption generation. 

The modelâ€™s central purpose is to detect objects in images, predict their relationships, and produce meaningful captions. The novelty lies in enhancing these generated captions through the utilization of an open-source API key, connecting to an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) like Chat GPT-4.

This method not only enhances engagement by generating captions that are relevant, informative, engaging and ensures the generation of ethical content by incorporating safeguards against bias, misinformation, and harm.
